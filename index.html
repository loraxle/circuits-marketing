      <h2><b>Circuits, Packets, and Protocols</b> tells the story of the engineers, entrepreneurs, investors, and visionaries who laid the groundwork and built the foundations of the Internet.</h2>
      <p>In the late 1960s, two American corporate behemoths were poised to dominate the rapidly converging industries of computing and communications—the computer giant, IBM, and the regulated telecommunications monopoly, AT&T. But in 1968, a key ruling by the Federal Communications Commission gave small businesses a doorway into an emerging market for communication devices that could transmit computer data over telephone lines. In the two decades that followed, an industry of networking technology emerged that would impact human history in profound and unfathomable ways.<span class="br"></span><b>Circuits, Packets, and Protocols</b> is a groundbreaking study of the men and women in the engineering labs, board rooms, and regulatory agencies whose decisions determined the evolution of our modern digital communication networks.<span class="br"></span><span class="column-break"></span>Unlike histories that glorify the dominant players with the benefit of hindsight, this is a history of a pivotal era as it happened. Drawing on more than 80 interviews recorded in 1988, the book features insights from now-famous individuals such as <b>Paul Baran, JCR Licklider, Vint Cerf, Louis Pouzin,</b> and <b>Robert Metcalfe.</b><span class="br"></span>Inspired by innovations from government-sponsored Cold War defense projects and the birth of the modern venture capital industry, these trailblazers and many others built the technologies and companies that became essential building blocks in the development of today’s Internet. Many of the companies and products failed, even while they helped propel the industry forward at breakneck speed.<span class="br"></span>Equal parts academic history and thrilling startup drama, <b>Circuits, Packets, and Protocols</b> gives the reader a vivid picture of what it was like to take part in one of the most exciting periods of technological advance in our time.</p>

      <h3>Emergence of Local Area Networks: Networking, 1976-1981</h3>
      <div>
        <h2>6.1 Overview</h2>
        <div class="readmore">
          <p>In the late 1970s, the second major market-structure of computer communications emerged: networking. For over a decade it co-evolved with, and finally eclipsed, the data communications market-structure before the two influenced the emergence and evolution of the third market-structure of computer communications: internetworking. By the end of this book, in 1988, total revenues for the three industries combined were over $5 billion.<span class="br"></span>
In the early 1970s, several pioneering engineers began to apply recent learning in the field of networking to innovate the use of networks for their employers’ in-house productivity, or as solutions to meet specific customer needs. But while these pioneers proved the technology could work, it would take until the end of the decade before the commercial success of networks could be validated in the market. By then, the explosion in business computing—mainframes and the increasingly popular minicomputer—had created a compelling need to connect computers to other computers, peripherals, and terminals throughout the enterprise. Customers began making demands on their vendors for connectivity.<span class="br"></span>
This demand was on display in May of 1979 at the Local Area Computer Networking symposium presented by MITRE and the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). The result was a watershed moment for the emerging market, which, when combined with the resurgence of venture capital, provided entrepreneurs with the right mix of opportunity and resources. Just 1 month later, in June, three of the leading networking companies, 3Com, Ungermann-Bass, and Sytek, were founded. Each differentiated to take advantage of what they saw as a unique market opportunity. They quickly discovered they did not have the market to themselves, as the existing data communication firms saw the same market signals and responded with products of their own.</p>
